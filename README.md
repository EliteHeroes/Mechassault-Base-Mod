# Mechassault Base Mod

This mod aims to improve and expand upon the foundation that the game MechAssault started. Adding new features and quality of life changes, such as more time and score options for multiplayer (including the Grinder game mode), as well as more options for mechs and mech skins in a variety of game modes. Unlockable mechs for multiplayer are now available from the start, and an easy to access mission loader has been added to make it so you can jump straight into gameplay! To install and play, it is recommended to download the [latest release](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Base-Mod/releases) and follow the install guide found below.

## Install Guide

### Pre-requisites

* Need to acquire a copy of Mechassault. Either installed on a modded Xbox or on a PC. If you have an ISO-type file, make sure to convert it so you can directly access the contents of the game files.
* You'll also need to download and install all of [Mechassault's DLC](https://digiex.net/threads/xbox-offline-xbox-live-downloadable-content-dlc-installers.675) for the best and complete experience.

### Installing

1. Download the latest version of the Base Mod from the '[Releases](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Base-Mod/releases)' page and extract the contents from 'Mechassault.Base.Mod.zip'.
2. Open your Mechassault game folder. For console, you can do this using an FTP program to connect a modded Xbox to a PC.
3. Drag and drop all the files from inside the 'Base Mod' folder into the Mechassault game folder, agreeing to replace the files.
4. If necessary, you can now convert the game folder to an XISO format so emulators such as [Xemu](https://xemu.app) can read the new game data.
5. And that's it! You'll now be able to select 'LAUNCH MODS' in the options menu of the game, or you can start the modded game directly with the new N1Launch.xbe

### Help

If the game isn't detecting the newly installed mods, here are some things you can try:

* Make sure the files you placed inside the Mechassault game folder is in the correct place. The new files need to be directly along side the other game files. You'll receive a prompt to replace existing files if you've done this right. For example, you should be able to see a new folder called 'MGFs' next to 'Movie' inside the game folder.
* If you're missing maps or mechs on the multiplayer select screen, you might not have installed all the DLC correctly. Start the DLC installer and check the list to verify all the options have been selected and installed.
* If the game crashes or refusues to load certain maps or campaign missions, either your game files are corrupted or your copy of Mechssault is incomplete. 

If you're still having any problems with installing, feel free to leave a message in the help section on the [MechDonald's Discord](https://discord.gg/yKpHC5EPz)

### Editing Modded Files

* If you wish to make you're own edits, you'll either need to download a build from the release page or from this repository as it contains the core mod files to start.
* Also make sure to check out the [MGF Explorer](https://github.com/LarvalExtract/MGF-Explorer) Github page by [LarvalExtract](https://github.com/LarvalExtract) for more information on opening and editing Mechassault's game files.
